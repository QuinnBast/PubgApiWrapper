# PubgApiWrapper
Custom wrapper for the PUBG API using python. Because the data is returned in a huge block of JSON, I converted the JSON data into different objects that can retreieve the data needed.

Using the API Wrapper, I will create a crawler which will go through various player profiles (unfortunately I am limited to 10 api requests per minute), and save the player data into a database. Using the data I will track some trends in PUBG for games over time and make some pretty graphics/images/graphs from the data.
